1. You will need to submit a short video to demonstrate the different features of the
program.
2. You will need to write a report to describe the project. Imagine that you are describing the
project/ data structures used to someone who has a coding background but who doesn't
know much about the project.
  - The document should contain a number of words in the range of 1000 to 2000 words 
    and should contain diagrams/ screenshots that demonstrate the projectâ€™s
    background and implementation details.
  - The report should be divided into sections such as background, implementation
         details and complexity of operations.
  - The report should contain a references section where the resources that you have
         used during the project are listed.
